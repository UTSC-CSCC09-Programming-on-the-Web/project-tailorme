## üìå Project Overview

Create a comprehensive digital platform that connects Islamic institutions, such as Mosques, Islamic schools, and organizations, with qualified individuals for religious and educational roles (e.g., imams, teachers, speakers, management etc.).

The platform aims to resolve the current inefficiencies in how mosques and professionals connect, especially during high-demand periods like Ramadan. The current process is informal, fragmented, and often dependent on word-of-mouth or social media. It also seeks to expand into a broader Islamic professional network for community growth and opportunity discovery.

UmmahWorks serves as a centralized job and service board tailored for the Muslim community. Whether you're a mosque looking for a Qur‚Äôan reciter, a speaker, or an organizer, or a professional looking to serve ‚Äî this platform bridges that gap.
