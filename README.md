## üìå Project Overview

Create a comprehensive digital platform that connects Islamic institutions, such as Mosques, Islamic schools, and organizations, with qualified individuals for religious and educational roles (e.g., imams, teachers, speakers, management etc.).

The platform aims to resolve the current inefficiencies in how mosques and professionals connect, especially during high-demand periods like Ramadan. The current process is informal, fragmented, and often dependent on word-of-mouth or social media. It also seeks to expand into a broader Islamic professional network for community growth and opportunity discovery.

UmmahWorks serves as a centralized job and service board tailored for the Muslim community. Whether you're a mosque looking for a Qur‚Äôan reciter, a speaker, or an organizer, or a professional looking to serve ‚Äî this platform bridges that gap.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js

## Additional Requirement

We will implement the requirement of "A piece of the application is ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù, which means it can reflect other user changes without refreshing." This will be done for real-time notifications in the web application.

## üìå Milestones


### Alpha Milestones
- **User Authentication & Payment**: Implement OAuth 2.0 login using Google and integrate Stripe Checkout for monthly subscription enforcement.
- **User & Institution Profiles**: User profiles for professionals (e.g. Imams, Huffaz) and institutions (e.g. Mosques, Islamic schools), including fields like profile pic, bio, and certifications/credentials (uploaded).
- **Event Promotion Feed**: Allow institutions to post community events (e.g., lectures, fundraisers) that users can browse, share (via link), and register for.


### Beta Milestones
- **Job Board Postings**: Enable institutions to post job opportunities (e.g. Taraweeh lead, Imam roles) with application package.
- **Job Board Feed**: Enable users to view available job opportunities and their details.
- **Application Workflow**: Professionals can apply to roles, and institutions can manage applicants through various stages (e.g., shortlisted, interview, offer).
- **Application Tracking Page**: A user and institution-facing timeline to show the current status of their job applications/postings, allowing them to track progress clearly.


### Final Version
- **Job Board Filtering**: Enable users to search for job opportunities and filter via location, availability, and role.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Implement socket-based notifications to display significant status changes (e.g., interview requested, application accepted) without requiring a page refresh.
- **Integrated Calendar**: Include a calendar interface where users can manage availability, view scheduled interviews, and register for upcoming events.
